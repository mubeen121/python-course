hello mubeen
hi 
"i want to eat  an  apple'''
# if we can want  to print this value one by one like array so this is so difficult to print b/c there are so many words and gaps and next line statement so this is so difficult
#so we can use for loop with string
# print(apple[3])
# print(apple[3])
# print(apple[3])#  so this type to print the above sharacter is difficult to pint so we can use loop with sting
# print(apple[3])
# print(apple[3])


#   NOW USE FOR LOOP WITH  STRING

for character in apple:
    print(character)   # so for more words and spaces we can simply use this loop and they can be  excute
