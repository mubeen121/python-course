name= "Mubeen" #so all the word are index and we can print all the words separate
#like this
print(name[0])# at zero index there are     (M)    so   m    can   be print 
print(name[1])#so there are print     MUBEEN like array   1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on it will be print how many index you have
print(name[2]) # if you have e.g 4 index and you can ,give 1 index more so they can show error
print(name[3])
