# it means in simple words that repeated value cannot be take douible it can be take one time

 # here we can also take value of differnt data type 
 #lets check the program 

info = {"Mubeen",19,True,2,3,4}
print (info)
#   there is no gurantee of order if we can order like this as you shown in the statement but if we can run it it show another order
# it means taht sts are order less

mubeen = {}
print (type(mubeen))    # if we can take an empty set and check it type so it show the   type   is   dict    but if we can put some variable in it then it show the set data type
#  b/c we cannot make set empty if we can make him empty so it  is   (dict) type 

# mk =  set()
# print(type(mk)) # if we can write here like taht  (   set()  )  then it will show empty set
