#conditional operation are:.
                             #   (< , > , <= , >= , != , ==   ) these are condititonal operation
#  lets make a program and use it


# print(a>18)  # it show falase check condition
# print(a>=18)# it show true check condition
# print(a<=18)# it show true check condition
# print(a>=18)# it show true check condition
# print(a==18)# it show true check condition
# print(a!=18)# it show false check condition

# un comment all to check them

if(a>18):             # here you must check a condition that what we can enter greater or smaller or equal to it must be check

    print("You can drive a car") # the space below the (if  or   else   condition) is called indition it means that you can enter in the ( if  or   else  condititon)

else:
