a= "1"
b=  "2"
print(a+b)
#the output of these are 12 b/c we in this we can cover 1 and 2 with doublecodes and when you can use doublecodes so they are string and they just can combine not adddedd if you can  use add sign 
a= "1"
b=  "2"
print(int(a)+int(b))#if you can use srting but in print statement use can use int so they are added again b/c the compiler knoww that tis is integer
