# for i in range (12):

#         break  # here we can use break and command him to go on  (   10   )only not going more so break  method is used b/c we will give him rang to   (    12     )

#     print("5 x ",i+1 ,"=",5*(i+1)) # if we want that table start with (   1   ) so we can write the print statemennt like this as we can see in the program

#     # if (i==10):      
       
#     #     break       # if we can use this break and for statement here so it's also work 
# print (" leave the loop")    

 ####   break sa pora loop he stop hojata ha

 #####  lakin continue sa matlab ka jaha tak jana ha tu waha ta chalee gayegee aur wo wala loop sa remove hogayaga aur pir next execute means  that it will remove that line and then continue to the the next line
   
   ## lets check

# for i in range (12):
    
#     if (i==10):  

#         print (" leave the loop")  

#         continue    #   means that this loop can stop on (     10   ) and then execute the other line seen to the range

#     print("5 x ",i+1 ,"=",5*(i+1))   
     


# i="mubeen"
# for name in i:
#     print(name)
#     if name=="b":
#         break
# else:
#     print('name complete print')
